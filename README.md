Government   10:   Quantitative   Political   Analysis
Fall   2024
Course   OverviewThe   growing   amount   of   available   quantitative   data   is   changing   the   way   we   understand   and   engage   in   politics,   how   we   implement   policy,   and   how   organizations   across   the   world   make   decisions.    In   this   course,   we   will learn   the   fundamental   tools   of quantitative   analysis   and   apply   them   to   a   wide   range   of political   and   policy   oriented   questions.    How   do   we   predict   presidential   elections?    Did   economic   voters   bring   Hitler   to   power?   How   does   the   ideology   of   the   Supreme   Court   change   over   time?    These   are   just   a   few   of   the   questions   we   will   work   on   in   the   course.Students   are   not   expected   to   have   any   programming   knowledge,   and   the   course   will   be   centered   around   assignments   that   will   help   build   R   statistical   skills   from   scratch.      Students   will   leave   the   course   equipped   for   work   in   any   setting   that   requires   a   social   scientific   approach   to   data   science,   from   policy   non-profits   to   government, from   Silicon   Valley   to   Wall   Street   and   beyond.    There   are   no   formal   prerequisites   for   this   course.
You   need   to   bring   your   laptops   to   class   so   that   we   can   actively   code   during   lecture.    This   will   help   you   “learn by   doing”   and   it   will   ensure   that   the   transition   from   lecture   to   lab   to   problem   sets   is   smooth.
TeachingThis will be a mostly   flipped   class.    You will   be   expected to   do   all   assigned   reading    before   class starts.    There will   be   some   lecture,   but   this   will   be   a   small   part   of   the   class.    We   will   work   together   in   class   on   exercises and   problem   sets.   We   will   meet   during   our   normally   scheduled   time   (3A)   throughout   the   term.
CommunicationOutside   of   class   and   office   hours,   I   can   be   reached   by   email.      However,   I   ask   that   you   primarily   use   Ed   Discussion   (I   find   that   most   students   have   similar   questions,   so   asking   on   Ed   Discussion   can   help   provide   an answer   to   other   students   who   might   not   want   to   reach   out   by   email).    Please   refer   to   this   document   if you   have   logistical   questions.   Also   feel   free   to   schedule   an   office   hour   meeting.   If you   can’t   wait   for   office   hours or   cannot   get   the   answer   on   Piazza,   email.
Study   Groups   and   Help
The   most   successful   students will   form   study   groups.   You   can work together   on   problem   sets,   but you   must   submit   your   own   work.   You   can   not   work   together   during   quizzes   or   exams.

We   will   use   the   Ed   D代 写Government 10: Quantitative Political Analysis Fall 2024Matlab
代做程序编程语言iscussion   (part   of   Canvas)   discussion   tool   in   this   course.    Ed   Discussion   allows   students to   ask   questions   about   course   content   and   assignments.    Both   I   and   other   students   will   respond   to   questions.   Use   of   Ed   Discussion   will   count   toward   class   participation   (15%   of   final   grades).    Questions   about   the   class,   assignments   and   R   should   be   posted   to   Ed   Discussion.
Statistical   Software
You   must   install   three   (free)   applications   for   this   class.    Please   make   sure   you   have   done   this   before   the   first day   of   class.
